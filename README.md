# Triangle Classification and Area Calculation

## Introduction

This C program classifies triangles as Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene, or Invalid based on user-entered side lengths. It also calculates the area for valid triangles. It's designed for educational purposes, demonstrating geometric principles and mathematical formula applications in programming.

## Algorithm

### Triangle Type Determination

**Logic:** 
- Validates if side lengths can form a triangle using the triangle inequality theorem.
- Classifies the triangle based on side length comparisons.

**Complexity Analysis:** Time Complexity: O(1), Space Complexity: O(1).

### Triangle Area Calculation

**Logic:** 
- Uses Heron's formula to calculate area.

**Complexity Analysis:** Time Complexity: O(1), Space Complexity: O(1).

## Benefits Over Alternative Approaches

This approach emphasizes input validation, readability, and efficiency by using well-defined functions for each task and constants for triangle types, which enhances maintainability and reduces error likelihood.
